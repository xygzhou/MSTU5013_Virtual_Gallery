# Virtual Gallery - Storytelling & Inspiration

This is a website dedicated to create an interactive experience for people who are working on their art projects during quarantine with no access to art museums and galleries.

## Rationale && Goals

* **Accessibility: Index Page (2/3)**
  * _**Color Contrast**_
    
    For people with color vision deficiency to access visual art resources, a button on this website can adjust the color contrast of texts and layouts. (Test on block area)
    
  * _**Font Size**_
  
    For people with low vision or younger children who have difficulty reading small texts, a button on this website can adjust the font size of text. (Test on block area)
    
  * _**Text-to-audio (imcomplete)**_
    
    For Blind people and people with low vision, a button on this website can enable text-to-audio function to read the options and tabs out loud
